# React.js Intern Assignment: Employee Management Dashboard

## Objective
Develop a comprehensive Employee Management Dashboard using React.js that demonstrates key React concepts, state management, and interaction with a mock API.

## Project Requirements

### 1. Project Setup
- Create a new React project using Create React App
- Use functional components and React Hooks
- Implement React Router for navigation
- Use a UI component library (recommended: Material-UI or Chakra UI)

### 2. Features to Implement

#### Dashboard
- Create a main dashboard displaying:
  - Total number of employees
  - Department-wise employee count
  - Recent joined employees
  - Quick stats and charts

#### Employee Management
- Develop CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for employees
- Implement the following pages/components:
  - Employee List
  - Employee Details
  - Add New Employee
  - Edit Employee Profile

### 3. State Management
- Use React Context or Redux for global state management
- Manage employee data state
- Implement state persistence using localStorage

### 4. API Integration
- Use JSON Server or MockAPI to simulate backend operations
- Implement axios or fetch for API calls
- Handle loading states and error handling

### 5. Routing
- Implement the following routes:
  - `/` - Dashboard
  - `/employees` - Employee List
  - `/employees/add` - Add New Employee
  - `/employees/:id` - Employee Details
  - `/employees/:id/edit` - Edit Employee

### 6. Additional Features
- Implement form validation
- Add search and filter functionality for employees
- Create responsive design
- Add authentication mock (login/logout)

## Technical Requirements
- React 18+
- React Router
- State management solution
- TypeScript (optional but recommended)
- Responsive design
- Error handling
- Loading states

## Bonus Challenges
1. Implement role-based access control
2. Add data visualization for employee statistics
3. Create unit tests using React Testing Library
4. Implement dark/light theme toggle

## Submission Guidelines
- Create a GitHub repository
- Include a comprehensive README.md
- Provide setup and run instructions
- Comment your code
- Handle edge cases and implement error boundaries

## Evaluation Criteria
- Code quality and organization
- Component design and reusability

- State Management: Context API or Redux
- UI Library: Material-UI or Chakra UI
- HTTP Client: Axios
- Mock Backend: JSON Server

## Estimated Time
- 3 days for a comprehensive implementation

## Learning Objectives
- Understand React component lifecycle
- Master React Hooks
- Learn state management techniques
- Implement responsive design
- Practice API integration
- Develop full CRUD functionality
